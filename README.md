# egr556_bikeproject
• Implemented a full-state feedback controller (FSF) and sliding mode controller (SMC) to stabilize an autonomous bike
for vehicle safety. 
• Estimated the maximum value of the initial roll angle to achieve stability as 0.63 degrees.
• Performed MATLAB simulations to observe that the FSF controller stabilizes the bicycle within 4 seconds; whereas,
with SMC, it is 50 seconds.
